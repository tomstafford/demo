## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r graph}

#you may want Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location as the very first thing you do

#libraries
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

#load data
df <- read.csv(here('processed','plotdat.csv'))

#plots

plot_df <- df %>%
  filter(cond=='post')


p <- ggplot(df,aes(x=rate,y=asrs,color=cond))
p+ geom_point()+geom_smooth(method=lm)

```
